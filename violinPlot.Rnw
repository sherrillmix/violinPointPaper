\section{Introduction}
The display of univariate data is a [[busy field]]. Display choices include using plots such as histograms, stem-and-leaf plots, boxplots, densities. For small- to moderately-sized datasets, [[need to reference graphpad]]. \citet{Wilkinson1999} symmetric or stacked dot plots (histogram-like). Violin plots \citep{Hintze1998}. bean plots \citep{Kampstra2008}.

Variable width square root of group size scaled width with many variability measures, e.g. standard error \citep{McGill1978}.


\section{Comparisons of visualizations}
beeswarm (multiple options), violin, boxplot, jitter on various data

\section{Examples of usage}
some nice examples of just our own stuff
